This function attempts to read n
byte bytes of data from the object
 referenced by the descriptor fildes
  into the buffer pointed to by buf.  The read() function 
starts at a position given by the poi
nter associated with fildes. At the end,
 the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes (nbyte) actually read.
